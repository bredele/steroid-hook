This module bind itself to nodeâ€™s require and automatically compile files on the fly to create jsx-like templates using ES6 only and [Steroid](https://github.com/bredele/steroid).

## Usage

```js
const html = require('steroid')

const component = html`
  <HelloMessage name="world" />
`

function HelloMessage(props) {
  return html`<h2>Hello ${props.name}</h2>`
}
```

When an element represents a user-defined component (a function starting with an uppercase character), it passes the defined attributes to this function as a single object as well as this element children.

## Installation

```shell
npm install steroid-hook --save
```

All subsequent files required by node with the defined extension will be transformed by this module.

```js
// transpile files with the html extension
require('steroid-hook')('.html')
```
